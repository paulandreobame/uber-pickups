# Uber Pickups
Clustering for identification of 'hot-zones' of Uber pick-ups demand in NYC

## Goal of the project

In order to **advise Uber drivers on where to be at which time**, the goal of this project is to **identify "hot-zones" from Uber pick-up requests data**, and display theses zones on a map.

We'll use 2 different clustering algorithms for this task (KMeans and DBSCAN) and compare their results.

## Datasets

The data provided for this project gathers Uber pick-uprequests in NYC from april to september 2014 and from january to june 2015, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city). 
**This analysis focuses on September 2014 data.**
